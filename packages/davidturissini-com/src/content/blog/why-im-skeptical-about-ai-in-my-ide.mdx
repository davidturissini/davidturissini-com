title: "Why I'm Skeptical About AI in my IDE"

## The Promise

I've recently made the switch from VS Code to Cursor as my full time IDE. In theory, it makes sense for an IDE to have integrated AI auto complete.  Who wouldn't want an LLM to suggest and auto complete code for them? Before the AI boom, we already did have auto complete for strongly typed languages and that was seens as a universal prodictivity boost. Imagine an AI version that would actually fill in entire blocks of code for you instead of just suggesting parameter names!

## The Reality

In practice, I find the promise of AI-based auto complete to be annoying at best and dangerous at worst. My workflow is increasingly becoming agent based. I'm being very productive by creating multiple git workspaces and "assigning" an agent to each workspace. Each agent then makes the changes I asked for and saves the files. I then go back and review the code and make my own changes before pushing the code.

My problem is, by the time I get back into my IDE, I've already had an AI do all the work for me. My IDE space is for _me_ to exclusively write code. I don't want Cursor suggesting AI edits.
